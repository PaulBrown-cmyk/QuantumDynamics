# QuantumDynamics
Codebase for the simulation of quantum dynamics within the harmonic oscillator approximation. 
The dynamics of the particle follows along a 1D-trajectory between two parabolic potentials. 
Both potentials are coupled via Gaussian or exponential coupling to allow for probability 
density to transfer from reactant state to the product state. We leverage the split-operator
to propagate the initial Gaussian proability with a small perturbation of the particles 
initial posiiton. The noneqiuilibrium displacement provides initial momentum and promotes 
dynamics.
